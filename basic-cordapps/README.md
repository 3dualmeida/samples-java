## samples-java/basic-cordapps

This folder features five sample projects, each of them demonstrates different features of corda.  

### [Database Access](./flow-database-access): 
This CorDapp provides a simple example of how the node database can be accessed in flows. In this case, the flows maintain a table of cryptocurrency values in the node's database.

### [HTTP Access](./flow-http-access): 
This CorDapp provides a simple example of how HTTP requests can be made in flows. In this case, the flow makes an HTTP request to retrieve the original BitCoin readme from GitHub.

### [Ping](./flow-send-msg): 
This CorDapp allows a node to ping any other node on the network that also has this CorDapp installed.

### [RPC Node Info](./rpc-nodeinfo):
